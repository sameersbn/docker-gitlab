# CHUNKED TRANSFER
# It is a known issue that Git-over-HTTP requires chunked transfer encoding [0] which is not
# supported by Nginx < 1.3.9 [1]. As a result, pushing a large object with Git (i.e. a single large file)
# can lead to a 411 error. In theory you can get around this by tweaking this configuration file and either
# - installing an old version of Nginx with the chunkin module [2] compiled in, or
# - using a newer version of Nginx.
#
# At the time of writing we do not know if either of these theoretical solutions works. As a workaround
# users can use Git over SSH to push large files.
